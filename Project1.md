#*ShapeDown*

##1. High Concept
Test your coordination and focus as you try to match the colors on the square to the shapes coming from every direction.

##2. Genre
Avoidance, precision and Puzzle

##3. Platform
Primarily for desktop, the application can also be used on the phone using tilt controls.

##4. Story
You must rotate a square with each side a different color and match the colors to incoming projectiles. The game should be intese since the player must ensure not to make a mistake and mismatch colors. The more shapes the player correctly matches, the faster the shapes come, and eventually the player will have to instead match shapes to colors, adding to the complexity. The player's motivation is to test themself, and attempt to go as far as they can as quickly as possible, all while trying to avoid making a mistake.

##5. Aesthetics
The art style is simplistic, with geometric shapes and basic rgb colors. The shapes themselves are only a few pixels each, and the main square in the middle is split into sections of red, yellow, green and blue. The goal with the graphics is to not distract the player too much from gameplay, and therefore to keep everything from getting unnecissarily cluttered. The sound is likely going to be a upbeat 8-bit beat with sound effects triggering whenever the player correctly matchs colors. Additionally there would be a sound effect when rotating the square.

##6. Gameplay
###Mechanics:
Player is able to rotate the central square in able to match the colored shapes coming from the sides. In it's most boiled down state this game is a color matching, reaction based game.
###Control:
When playing on computer the player must use the left and right arrow keys to rotate the square 90 degrees in that direction. On mobile the player uses the accelerometer by tipping the phone either way to make the square rotate that direction.
###New Player Experience:
The game starts slowly by only having a few block drop slowly from the simple pattern. After the player gets a few correct the shapess start speeding up, and if the player continues to do well then the shapes start coming in from the sides and the bottom. Finally, the game will switch from having the player match colors, to having them match shapes, forcing the player to overcome their muscle memory.
###Player learning:
As the game progresses the player must think ahead to ensure they are able to correctly switch the square in time to match the next color. Eventually the player will also have to manage having shapes coming from different directions, and must quickly decide which is the closest and match that while also keeping an eye on the other directions.
